CHAMBER LED LIGHTING DOOR SWITCH MOD
(W/ MANUAL & SOFTWARE CONTROL OPTIONS)

	This is a mod that adds a "mode" switch between manual and auto LED light bar operation. 
	When the "mode" switch is turned to auto, opening either door will turn on the LED light 
	bar, and closing them will turn it off. When the "mode" switch is turned to manual, the 
	on/off switch turns the LED light bar on and off.
 
	Additionally, the light bar can still be controlled from within Klipper by utilizing an 
	extra heater output on the main board. In my application, I'm using the BTT Manta M8P 
	V2.0 mainboard, and I have the light bar connected to the HE2 terminals.
